Hi! This project is designed for a React Bootcamp, intended to recreate a hypothetical humanoid e-commerce platform. It also includes Material UI library for the user interface.

The site is currently in its initial stages, so I will be updating it. 

## Running the site

To install dependencies and run the site:

1.  Download or clone repository.
2.  Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
3.  Run `npm run dev` for site visualization.

### Notes

✓ The site is designed for 1920x1080 screen resolution 

✓ Live Preview: [Luxury Robot Design]([https://parallaxhumanoid.web.app](https://parallax-humanoid.web.app/))
